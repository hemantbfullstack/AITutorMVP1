Classification of Matter  
Since ancient times, people have tried to understand the world around them. Early 
Indian philosophers believed that all matter,  living and nonliving, comprises five 
basic elements known as the Panchtatva: Air, Water, Earth, Sky, and Fire. Similarly, 
ancient Greek philosophers developed a comparable classification of matter. Today, 
scientists classify matter based on its physical properties and chemical nature. 
Physical Nature of Matter 
Two views existed about matter: continuous (like a solid block) and particulate (like 
sand). 
Activity: Dissolve 2–3 potassium permanganate crystals in 100 mL water. 
Observation: The colour remains visible even after dilution, showing that each crystal 
contains millions of particles that disperse further. 

 

Characteristics of Particles of Matter 
 Particles of matter have space between them. For example, when you dissolve 
sugar in water, you can stir in more sugar because the space between the water 
molecules allows the sugar particles to fit in. 
 Particles of Matter Are Continuously Moving. For instance, perfume spreads 
throughout a room as the particles move through the air. 
 Particles of Matter Attract Each Other: An example is water droplets forming on 
a cold glass; the water molecules are attracted and stick together to form 
droplets. 
States Of Matter 
Look around and observe that states of matter exists in three distinct states: solid, 
liquid, and gas. These states result from variations in the characteristics of the 
particles of matter.

Can Matter Change its State? 
Matter can change its physical state by altering temperature, pressure, or both. For 
example, heating can turn a solid into a liquid (melting) or a liquid into a gas 
(evaporation), while cooling can reverse these processes. Increasing pressure can also 
turn gases into liquids or solids. 

 

Effect of Temperature on Matter 
Melting (Fusion): As a solid's temperature rises, its particles gain energy, vibrate faster, 
and eventually break free, turning the solid into a liquid. The temperature remains 
constant at the melting point as heat is used to overcome particle attraction. This 
absorbed heat is called the latent heat of fusion. 
Boiling (Vaporization): When heat is added to a liquid, particles move faster until they 
gain enough energy to become a gas. The temperature at which this occurs is the 
boiling point. Latent heat of vaporization is the energy needed to convert 1 kg of liquid 
into gas at the boiling point. 
When Temperature Decreases 
 Gases: Lower temperatures reduce the kinetic energy of gas particles, causing 
them to condense into a liquid (e.g., clouds forming). 
 Liquids: Lowering the temperature causes liquids to solidify (e.g., water 
freezing into ice). 
Special Cases: 
 Sublimation: A solid changes directly into a gas without becoming a liquid. 
 Deposition: A gas changes directly into a solid without becoming a liquid. 
Thus, temperature changes can shift matter between different states. 
Effect of Change of Pressure 
Applying pressure can compress particles of matter, bringing them closer together and 
changing their state. For example, CO₂ gas can be solidified by increasing pressure 
and lowering temperature. 
Evaporation occurs at the surface of a liquid when it turns into vapour at temperatures 
below its boiling point. 
Factors Affecting Evaporation: 
 Surface Area: A larger surface area increases evaporation. 
 Temperature: Higher temperatures speed up evaporation. 

 Humidity: Lower humidity levels enhance evaporation. 
 Wind Speed: Increased wind speed accelerates evaporation. 
Evaporation Cause Cooling 
As a liquid evaporates, its particles absorb energy from the surroundings to replace 
the energy lost during evaporation. This absorption of energy from the surrounding 
environment results in a cooling effect.
